# Simple store
This is a simple application that has a partial implementation of an online store's functionality.
It was created to demonstrate how Domain Driven Design can be implemented using the following technologies:
- **Python** ‚Äì programming language
- **FastAPI** ‚Äì web framework
- **Pydantic** ‚Äì library for creating models and validating them
- **SQLAlchemy** ‚Äì ORM for working with a database


## Requirements for setup
- **Docker**
- **PostgreSQL**


## Setup
1. Create a database for the project.
2. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cd simple_store
    mv .env.example .env
    ```

3. Set the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The `DATABASE_URL` must start with `postgresql+asyncpg:`.

4. Apply the database dump.
	```bash
	psql -d <db_name> -f db_dumps/orders.sql
	```


## Running the project
1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd simple_store
    ```

2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    make docker-run
    ```
   or alternatively, run:

    ```bash
    docker run --network=host --env-file=.env workaccpy/simple_store:latest
    ```

   **IMPORTANT**: The first time you run these commands, you must have an internet connection because the Docker image of the application is downloaded from Docker Hub.


## Endpoints

### FastAPI API Documentation

FastAPI provides automatically generated and interactive documentation for API, making it easy to explore, test,
and understand the available endpoints.
Below are the key documentation tools available by default:

#### üöÄ **Swagger UI** (`/docs`)

The [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) is available at the `/docs` endpoint.
It offers an intuitive and interactive interface where you can:

- **Visualize**: See the structure of API, with all routes and their details neatly organized.
- **Interact**: Send requests to the API directly from the browser, testing endpoints without additional tools.
- **Understand**: Quickly grasp how the API works, with descriptions of each route, parameters, and expected responses.

---

#### üé® **ReDoc** (`/redoc`)

At the `/redoc` endpoint, you will find [ReDoc](https://redoc.ly/), a beautifully minimal and user-friendly documentation tool.
While it doesn‚Äôt provide the interactivity of Swagger UI, it excels in presenting:

- **Clean design**: ReDoc offers a structured and modern view of the API, making it easy to browse.
- **Efficient navigation**: ReDoc‚Äôs documentation is organized into collapsible sections, perfect for quickly finding specific endpoints.

---

#### üõ† **OpenAPI Schema** (`/openapi.json`)

The `/openapi.json` endpoint serves the complete **OpenAPI schema** for Simple Store application in JSON format.
This schema is a machine-readable representation of API, defining all endpoints, their parameters, request bodies, and responses.
It can be:

- **Used by tools**: Integrate API with tools that support OpenAPI for automation, code generation, and validation.
- **A standard**: As an OpenAPI-compliant schema, it provides a universal way to describe API for both humans and machines.

This schema powers both Swagger UI and ReDoc.
